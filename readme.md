# please help me figure out how to package this so people don't have to install everything to use it

on that note, here's what you need to install to use it:

- python 3.10
- pyimgui\[glfw\] but manually build the [dev/version-2.0 branch](https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui/tree/dev/version-2.0)

I think that's it but I'm probably wrong who knows

also this is definitely not a finished thing there will be problems and bugs please report them
